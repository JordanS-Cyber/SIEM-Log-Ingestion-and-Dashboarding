# SIEM-Log-Ingestion-and-Dashboarding

## Current Plan

### The Tools: Use Splunk (Free/Developer tier), Sysmon, Windows VM, VirtualBox, Ubuntu

### The Project: Ingest logs from my Windows VM using Sysmon and create a custom dashboard that visualizes:

-Failed vs. Successful RDP logins.

-PowerShell execution frequency.

-Anomalous process creation (e.g., cmd.exe spawning from outlook.exe).

### The Proof: Hosting my configuration files (inputs.conf, outputs.conf) and screenshots of my dashboards and process
